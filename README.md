# Map Points

Draw geopoints on map from a URL using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/).

# Usage

Open a URL with parameter `points`, which contains semicolon-separated values.
Each value is built either as `lat,lon` or as `lat,lon,description`.
The boundaries of the map are adjusted to the points provided.
